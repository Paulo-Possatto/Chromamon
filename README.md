# Chromamon

Chromamon is a microservices-based system designed to analyze and process chromatographic data from transformer insulating oil in electrical substations. The system provides comprehensive analysis, diagnostics, and reporting capabilities through various specialized services.

## System Architecture

The project is structured into multiple microservices, each with its specific responsibility and database:

### Microservices

#### Analysis Service
- Reads and processes chromatographic data from XLSX files
- Performs data enrichment and enumeration
- Stores processed data in PostgreSQL
- Technologies: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, PostgreSQL

#### Diagnostic Service
- Processes analysis data using various chromatographic analysis methods. For now, it's the following:
  - IEEE Method
  - Rogers Method
  - Duval Triangle Method
- Stores diagnostic results in MongoDB
- Technologies: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, MongoDB

#### Transformer Service
- Manages transformer-related information:
  - Lifecycle data
  - Location information
  - Condition monitoring
- Stores transformer data in MySQL
- Technologies: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, MySQL

#### Exporter Service
- Generates PDF reports based on transformer and analysis data
- Uses JasperSoft Studio for report template design
- Stores document metadata in MongoDB
- Technologies: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, MongoDB, JasperSoft Studio

#### API Gateway
- Manages API calls to all Chromamon services
- Provides centralized routing and load balancing
- Technologies: Java 21, Spring Boot 3

### Technology Stack

#### Backend
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.5.0
- Maven
- Apache Kafka (for inter-service communication)
- Multiple databases:
  - PostgreSQL
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
- JasperSoft Studio (for report generation)
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

#### Frontend (Future Development)
- Angular framework
- Modern responsive design
- Interactive data visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Run the following command to start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build all service containers
- Set up the required databases
- Configure the network between services
- Start the API Gateway

Detailed configuration and environment variables will be documented in each service's directory.

## Documentation

Documentation for API endpoints (REST/GraphQL) will be added once the API design is finalized.
